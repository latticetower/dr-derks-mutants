# üöÄ Submission Instructions

To submit to the challenge you'll need to ensure you've set up an appropriate repository structure, create a private git repository at https://gitlab.aicrowd.com with the contents of your submission, and push a git tag corresponding to the version of your repository you'd like to submit.

Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/dr-derks-mutant-battlegrounds/submissions/new).

## Repository Structure
We have created this sample submission repository which you can use as reference.

#### aicrowd.json
Each repository should have a aicrowd.json file with the following fields:

```
{
    "challenge_id" : "evaluations-api-drderk",
    "grader_id": "evaluations-api-drderk",
    "authors" : ["aicrowd-user"],
    "description" : "Dr. Derk Challenge Submission",
    "license" : "MIT",
    "gpu": false
}
```
This file is used to identify your submission as a part of the Dr. Derk Challenge.  You must use the `challenge_id` and `grader_id` specified above in the submission. The `gpu` key in the `aicrowd.json` lets your specify if your submission requires a GPU or not. In which case, a NVIDIA-K80 will be made available to your submission when evaluation the submission.

## Writing your own bot
You can start with the default bot.py or create your own agent that file. You can also your own script containing DerkPlayer class format present in bot.py.

**NOTE**: Only `bot.py` will be used during evaluation. Other bots can be used by you for running locally.

The functions that are required in the DerkPlayer class are:
* `__init__`: To initialize your player and will have the parameters `n_agents` and `action_space`
* `signal_env_reset`: To signal to your player that the environment has been reset and has the parameters `observation`
* `take_action`: This is the function where the observation will be passed and the actions for each agent are returned.

Please don't change the definition of these functions. You can add more if you want to.

# Running the Starter Kit
Run the python script:
```bash
python run.py -n 1
```

The python script has the following command line arguments: 
```console
usage: run.py [-h] [-p1 FILE_NAME_OF_PLAYER1] [-p2 FILE_NAME_OF_PLAYER2]
              [-n NUMBER_OF_ARENAS] [--fast]

optional arguments:
-h: to display help messages
-p1: The name of the file that contains player 1
-p2: The name of the file that contains player 2
-n: The number of arenas to run parallely (defaults to 2)
--fast: To enable turbo mode or not (cuts down episode time by half by speeding up animations)
```

For example, if you have `bot.py` and `oldbot.py` inside the `agent` directory, you can have a fight between them by running

```
python run.py -p1 bot -p2 oldbot
```
